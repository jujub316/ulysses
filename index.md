### Details

Blockchain, the distributed-ledger technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, paves the way for a 21st century definition of a “well-regulated militia”. This decentralized technology (specifically smart contracts) could be used to share liability - a “well-regulated militia” could be a group of individuals that shares the risk for an individual’s weapon. If you are a gun owner, a well regulated militia could be a group of people who believe you are OK to have a firearm. They so much believe that you are ok, that they will collectively bear the financial and legal responsibility in case you go “off the rails” or fail to prevent a child from taking your weapon. They might also be assured that you won’t hurt yourself with your own weapon. If you want a weapon and you are trustworthy and healthy, surely it will not be difficult to find others who agree.
